# Super-Market-Sales-Dashboard

The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competition is also high.
The goal of this analysis is to generate informational graphs and other information that is helpful to decide by the administration to enhance the performance of the supermarkets. The dataset is one of the historical sales of a supermarket company that has been recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months of data.
This is a Python-based interactive dashboard. For the styling, CSS language was used, and for marking the dash app HTML language was used.
